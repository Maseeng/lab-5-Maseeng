# LAB 5: WORKING WITH RASTERS
Due: 28 April 2020

##  WHAT TO SUBMIT
You will submit a file to your Github repo via Moodle. Your repo will contain a combination of scripts and screenshots of outputs. You will need to create your own `.py` files for the repo. *Be sure they all contain good comment headers!* Specifically you need to submit:
- `listrasters.py` – with your output noted in a comment block. 
- `describerasters.py` – Including:
   - A block comment in your code that contains the output for steps #4 and #5. 
   - Appropriate code for steps #6, #7, and #8.
   - Output for steps #6, #7, and #8 as a comment block in your code
- `describetif.py` – including output as a comment code.
- `describe_band1.py` – including output as a comment code.
- `slope_elevation.py` – along with the code for the analysis 
- `exportrasters.py` - along with the exported png files for the slope, elevation, and final (slope and elevation) outputs. 
- `slope.py` - Including the png image for slope_per raster

There is no README required for this lab. However, a good README with documentation will help you re-use these scripts in the future and demonstrate your technical and documentation skills to potential employers.
